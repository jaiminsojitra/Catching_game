Catching fish and bomb game in Unity

Here you can see I have made a Fish Catching Game using Unity and Visual Studio Community 2019

I used Four images ground, fish bomb and the basket for catching fish. You can see the score increases by one when you catch a fish and decrease by one when you catch a bomb.

I have made a c#script file for the movement of Basket, as you can see the if we press the right arrow, it will move towards right and if you press left arrow it will move to left. And I have also assigned values so that the basket does not go out of the screen.

We also have to make a time destroyer c# script file to destroy all the uncatched fish and bomb a particular time.

I have also made a spawner file show that it can randomly generate fish and bomb.

we also need a script to detect the fish and bomb and increase and decrease the score accordingly. And tagged the fish as Fishy and Bomb as Boom.
